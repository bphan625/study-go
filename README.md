repo for summary of go study 
1. Variable declaration

var test1 string
var test2 string = "test2"
test3 := "test3"
(depends you want to get more type detail)

Upper case first letter variable can be import to other packages
Lower case first letter var only works on local package

Can't redeclare variables, but can shadow them

Type conversion
float32 to int may lose acc
number to string need use convert function
